# Auth — shared secret

unleashd is a single-user personal tool, so auth is one shared secret rather
than accounts. This doc covers what that does and does not buy you, because the
answer depends entirely on which network path you reach the app over.

## What it protects

Everything. The gate is mounted before every route (`registerAuthRoutes` at the
top of the Express Routes section in `server/src/server.ts`) and before the
WebSocket upgrade, so an unauthenticated caller cannot read conversations, list
providers, browse the filesystem via `/api/filesystem`, upload files, drive an
agent, or even discover which endpoints exist. The static app shell is behind
the same gate.

The WebSocket matters most: it carries the whole command surface (create
conversation, queue message, run an agent in any working directory). That is
why the server uses `new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })` plus an explicit
`server.on('upgrade')` handler. `new WebSocketServer({ server })` accepts every
upgrade before any application code runs — restoring it silently republishes
the command channel.

## Configuring the secret

In precedence order:

1. `UNLEASHD_AUTH_TOKEN` — env var.
2. `UNLEASHD_AUTH_TOKEN_FILE` — path to a file holding the token. A named file
   that cannot be read is a startup error, never a fallback to no auth.
3. `<UNLEASHD_DATA_DIR>/auth-token` — the conventional default, normally
   `~/.agent-viewer/auth-token`. This is the recommended option.

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/.agent-viewer/auth-token
```

Prefer the file over the env var. The server spawns agent CLIs as child
processes and children inherit the environment, so a secret in
`UNLEASHD_AUTH_TOKEN` is readable by every agent the server launches.

Do **not** put the token in `~/.agent-viewer/settings.json` — that file is
served verbatim by `GET /api/settings`.

Tokens shorter than 16 characters are rejected at startup.

## Startup policy (`server/src/auth/policy.ts`)

`resolveAuthPolicy` is the single place the decision is made:

| Token configured | Listen host | Result |
|---|---|---|
| yes | any | auth required on every request |
| no | loopback | open, with a warning — localhost dev keeps working |
| no | anything else | **refuses to start** |
| no, `UNLEASHD_AUTH_DISABLED=1` | any | open, explicitly |

Refusing to start on a non-loopback bind without a token is the point of the
feature: exposing the port must be a decision, not an accident.

The Vite dev server follows the same rule from the other direction. Without a
token it binds `127.0.0.1` only; a configured token is what earns `host: true`.
Before this, `pnpm dev` bound every interface and proxied `/api` and `/ws`
straight to the backend, so anyone on the same wifi had the full API at
`http://<lan-ip>:7489` — the backend's own loopback bind did nothing to stop it.

## Presenting the secret

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — scripts, curl, anything non-browser.
- `unleashd_auth` cookie — set by the login form or a magic link. This is what
  authorizes the WebSocket: browsers cannot attach an Authorization header to
  `new WebSocket()`. Attributes, and why each one is what it is:

  | Attribute | Value | Reason |
  |---|---|---|
  | `Max-Age` | `31536000` (365 days) | Persistent, **not** a session cookie — otherwise the phone re-prompts every time Safari evicts the tab. Kept under Chrome's 400-day clamp. |
  | `HttpOnly` | always | Keeps the secret out of `document.cookie`, and out of ITP's 7-day cap on script-writable storage. |
  | `Secure` | only over https | A `Secure` cookie is dropped outright over http, so the loopback/LAN dev path would never stay signed in. Driven by `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which `tailscale serve` sets. |
  | `SameSite` | `Lax` | `Strict` withholds the cookie on cross-site navigations — opening unleashd from a link in Messages or Mail would show the login page despite a valid session. |
  | `Path` | `/` | One scope for the app, the API, and `/ws`. |

  `Lax` is safe here: it still withholds the cookie from cross-site
  subresources (fetch, XHR, the WebSocket handshake) and cross-site POSTs, and
  every mutating route is a POST or a WS command — the GET surface is read-only
  by construction, which the mutation gate in `server.ts` already assumes. The
  one GET with an effect is `/__auth/logout`, so a hostile page could navigate
  you to it and sign you out; an annoyance, not a disclosure.
- `?token=<token>` on a GET navigation — sets the cookie and immediately
  redirects to the same URL without the parameter. Convenient for bookmarking
  on a phone; note the token does pass through browser history and any proxy
  access log on the way.

Because the cookie is same-origin, `fetch()` and `new WebSocket()` send it
automatically — no client call sites needed changing.

`GET /__auth/logout` clears the cookie and returns to the login page.

## The login page

`server/src/auth/login-page.ts` renders a standalone, server-rendered document.
It cannot be a React route: the gate blocks the app bundle itself, so the page
has to render before any of the client's JS is reachable. That also means it
cannot consume `client/src/index.css`, so it repeats the Solarized `--theme-*`
values literally — keep the two in sync.

Routes:

| Route | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `GET /__auth/login` | 200 + the form. Honours `?redirectTo=` and `?error=`. |
| `POST /__auth/login` | Content-negotiated: JSON for the enhanced form, 302/HTML for a plain form POST. |
| `GET /__auth/logout` | Clears the cookie, redirects to `?error=signed-out`. |

Error states are a named sum (`LoginNotice`), not a boolean, so "wrong key" and
"signed out" cannot collapse into one message:

- **Wrong key** → `Invalid access key, try again.` The form submits with
  `Accept: application/json` specifically so it can render this inline instead
  of reloading; a 302/HTML-only response would make the two indistinguishable.
- **Server unreachable** → `Cannot reach the server…`, from the `fetch` rejection
  path. A plain form POST cannot report this at all, which is why the page
  enhances the submit rather than relying on the browser's default.
- **No JS** → the plain `<form method="post">` still works and gets the HTML 401
  with the same message.

Mobile specifics that are load-bearing, not cosmetic: the input is explicitly
`font-size: 16px` (anything smaller makes iOS Safari zoom on focus), the page
uses `100svh` and `env(safe-area-inset-*)`, and the Paste button is created only
when `window.isSecureContext && navigator.clipboard?.readText` — outside a
secure context `navigator.clipboard` is undefined, the same trap gates G4/G5
guard against in `tools/check-client-invariants.sh`.

### Recovering an expired session

`client/src/auth/session.ts` wraps `window.fetch` once at boot: a 401 from any
same-origin request redirects to `/__auth/login?redirectTo=<current path>`.
There is no single API client to hook — roughly 45 call sites use `fetch`
directly — so the wrapper keeps the recovery in one place instead of spreading
an auth concern across every caller. `GET /__auth/login` is deliberately
ungated; if it 401'd, the redirect would loop.

The WebSocket hands no status code to its error handler, so a rejected upgrade
is indistinguishable from a dead server there. `useWebSocket` fires one cheap
`/api/settings` probe on disconnect: a 401 trips the wrapper and redirects,
anything else means the failure was not about auth and the reconnect loop owns
it.

## Is a shared secret enough?

It depends on the wire, not on the secret.

A shared key is a **bearer credential**: whoever presents it is you. It is only
ever as private as the channel carrying it. unleashd is served over plain http,
so:

- **Over Tailscale** — fine. The request is inside a WireGuard tunnel, so the
  key is encrypted end to end between your devices and cannot be sniffed by
  anything between them. Tailnet-only serve (no Funnel) means only your own
  devices can even open the connection; the key is the second layer.
- **Over the LAN** — weaker. Plain http means the key crosses the wire in
  cleartext, readable by anyone who can see your traffic (a shared or hostile
  wifi, an untrusted router). It is a real improvement over no auth — it stops
  casual and automated access from anything that merely reaches the port — but
  it is only as safe as the network you are on.

The honest summary: a shared key is proportionate for a single-user tool and it
closes the "anyone who can reach the port owns the machine" hole. It is not a
substitute for transport security on an untrusted network.

### Recommended hardening

Both are cheap and each removes the cleartext-on-the-wire caveat:

1. **Serve over https through Tailscale.** One command, real cert, no config
   change in this repo:

   ```bash
   tailscale serve --bg --https 443 http://127.0.0.1:7499
   ```

   This also makes the page a *secure context*, which fixes the
   `crypto.randomUUID` / `navigator.clipboard` unavailability that gates G4 and
   G5 in `tools/check-client-invariants.sh` exist to work around.

2. **Keep the backend bound to loopback** (the default) and let Tailscale be
   the only thing that reaches it. If you want the backend itself on the
   tailnet interface instead, set `UNLEASHD_HOST=100.64.36.46` — a non-loopback
   bind now requires a token, so this cannot be done accidentally.

Do not enable Tailscale Funnel unless you specifically want the app on the
public internet; with Funnel on, the shared key becomes the *only* thing
between the internet and full agent execution on this machine.

## Known gaps

- No rate limiting on the login form. On a tailnet-only deployment the attacker
  set is your own devices; on a Funnel deployment this would need to change.
- No rate limiting on the login form (see above).

## Why both servers need an `upgrade` handler

Connect middleware — `server.middlewares.use()` in the Vite plugin, and Express
in the backend — only ever runs on the HTTP server's `request` event. A
WebSocket does not arrive as a `request`; it arrives as an `upgrade`. So a
middleware-only gate never sees a socket at all, and the socket is open to
anyone who can reach the port.

Both servers therefore carry an explicit upgrade handler, and both must keep
one:

- **Backend (`server.ts`)** — `new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })` plus
  `server.on('upgrade')`. This protects `/ws`, the whole command channel.
- **Vite dev server (`client/vite.config.ts`)** — `prependListener('upgrade')`,
  which protects Vite's HMR socket. `prependListener`, not `on`: Vite attaches
  its own upgrade listener when the dev server is built, and ours has to reject
  the socket before that one completes the handshake.

This was a live hole until it was fixed: `wss://<host>/` with
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: vite-hmr` and no credentials upgraded successfully from
the LAN as well as the tailnet. Vite's own `?token=` guard does not cover it —
that only engages when an `Origin` header is present (its CVE-2025-24010
mitigation), so a non-browser client just omits `Origin`. What leaked was file
paths and edit activity, not conversation data.

Regression check, which should return `401` on every line:

```bash
node -e "const {WebSocket}=require('ws');
  for (const u of ['ws://127.0.0.1:7489/','ws://127.0.0.1:7489/ws'])
    new WebSocket(u,'vite-hmr').on('unexpected-response',(_q,r)=>console.log(u,r.statusCode));"
```
