/**
 * Event-loop stall monitor: every pause of the only JS thread longer than
 * Pattern: fix-guards (docs/patterns.md#fix-guards)
 * STALL_THRESHOLD_MS becomes an error-journal occurrence.
 *
 * Why: on 2026-09-25 an authed trivial 404 measured p50 2.5ms but p90 1.16s and
 * max 18.1s on the live dev backend. Nothing recorded those stalls, so each one
 * was found by hand. A stall is invisible from inside the code that causes it;
 * only a timer that fires LATE sees it, after the fact.
 *
 * Detection is `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay`: a native 10ms timer whose
 * lateness is recorded without entering JS, so a stall's duration is accurate
 * to ~10ms. A plain JS interval measuring its own drift is not enough: a stall
 * that begins partway through the interval reads short by that phase, so with
 * a 50ms interval a 120ms stall could measure under 100ms and be missed. The JS
 * check runs every CHECK_INTERVAL_MS, equal to the threshold, so any stall at
 * or over the threshold makes the check due before the loop resumes; it then
 * runs in the timers phase, before that iteration's I/O callbacks can note a
 * newer activity.
 *
 * Attribution: HTTP requests, WS commands and the known timers call
 * `noteActivity(label)`, which is two variable writes, so the hot path pays for
 * a timestamp and nothing else. When a stall is detected the most recently
 * noted activity is reported with how long before detection it started. It is
 * the prime suspect, not proof: a stall inside an async continuation of an
 * older activity is attributed to whatever was noted last.
