//! Pattern: one-type-source (docs/patterns.md#one-type-source)
//!
//! The rows the crate hands to TS. Every type here is also the generated `index.d.ts` type
//! (napi-rs derives it from these definitions), so this file is the one source of the contract.
//!
//! Times are epoch milliseconds (`f64`, what JS `Date.getTime()` returns). A time is `null`
//! only where the transcript does not record one (Cursor lines carry no timestamps); it is never
//! invented. The TS parsers used `new Date()` in those places, which made every re-parse
//! produce a different history.
