//! Ordered ids: time-ordered UUIDv7 (RFC 9562) from ONE monotonic generator per process.
//!
//! Order by these ids, never by timestamp ties. Posts used to sort by `(created_at, id)` with
//! random v4 ids, so posts written in one millisecond read back shuffled (29 of 50 three-reply
//! threads, 2026-09-25), which broke "is this the thread's newest post" (follow-up gating), the
//! Buddy-chain bound, read cursors and keyset paging. Guard: core.rs
//! `posts_read_back_in_write_order_within_a_millisecond`.
//!
//! Why a tiny generator rather than `uuid::Uuid::now_v7()`: `now_v7` is monotonic per process,
//! but the importer must give legacy rows ids at THEIR write time (an explicit timestamp) from the
//! same counter, and read cursors need a "ceiling" key (the last possible id of a millisecond).
//! Both need the bit layout in hand, and it is 40 lines: RFC 9562 §6.2 Method 1 — a 12-bit counter
//! in `rand_a`, seeded randomly with its top bit clear at each new millisecond and incremented
//! within one; on overflow the id's timestamp moves to the next millisecond (the RFC's allowance).
//! A clock that steps back keeps the last millisecond. `created_at` is never adjusted.

// Pattern: ordered-ids (docs/patterns.md#ordered-ids)
