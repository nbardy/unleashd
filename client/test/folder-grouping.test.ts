/**
 * Regression, incident 2026-09-06. The sidebar's recent-folder groups keyed on
 * the raw working directory, so every oompa worktree iteration got its own
 * group header: 1,107 groups for room-runners-arena-lib alone, each rendering
 * as the same truncated `~/git/room-runners-aren…` with one thread under it.
 *
 * The fold lives in `getProjectRoot`, which is shared with the Swarm dashboard.
 * Narrowing that regex there would silently shatter the sidebar again, and
 * nothing else asserts the sidebar depends on it.
