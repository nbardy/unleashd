## The problem

You run agents from different CLIs — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode. Each has its own terminal, its own session history, its own way of showing what happened. When you're running a swarm of agents across a codebase, there's no single place to see what's going on, steer the work, or review what was done.

## What unleashd does

Two things:

**1. Visibility and organization across all your agents.**
See every conversation from every CLI agent, organized by project. Search across all of them. No more flipping between terminals trying to remember which agent you asked to do what.

**2. Launch and manage long-running agent swarms.**
Swarms are treated as two things at once:

- **Background jobs** — they run in a loop, autonomously, without interruption.
- **Artifacts** — they can be inspected, discussed, and steered through conversation.

Swarms continue without you. But you guide them. From the same chat interface, you can launch a swarm, check its progress, debug a failing worker, or review its output.

### Swarm Analytics

Track multi-agent swarm runs — iterations, merges, rejections, per-worker timelines.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and at least one supported CLI agent installed and authenticated (e.g. `claude`).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Development uses [http://localhost:7489](http://localhost:7489) by default. Run `pnpm local-domain:setup` once if you prefer [http://unleashd.localhost](http://unleashd.localhost), and `pnpm local-domain:remove` to remove it. The setup command installs a persistent, loopback-only macOS port proxy; dev startup only detects it and never prompts for administrator access. Unleashd itself always runs as your normal user. In dev, the API server stays on port `7499` behind the Vite proxy.

Frontend edits reload immediately. Backend edits are coalesced by the development watcher: if Codex or another provider has active turns, the current backend keeps owning their event streams until they finish, then exits and starts the updated server. An explicit `Ctrl-C`, `SIGTERM`, or `pnpm dev:replace` remains an intentional shutdown and stops active turns.

### Production

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start     # serves built client + API on port 7489
```

### Access key

By default both servers bind loopback only and no key is required. To reach
unleashd from another device (Tailscale, LAN), set a shared secret first:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 | tee ~/.agent-viewer/auth-token
```

With a key configured, every request and the WebSocket require it, and the dev
server starts listening on all interfaces. Without one, binding a non-loopback
address is refused at startup rather than silently exposing the API.

Sign in through the form at any URL, or bookmark `http://<host>:<port>/?token=<key>`
on a phone — it stores an HttpOnly cookie and strips itself from the URL. Scripts
use `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.

A shared key is a bearer credential, so it is only as private as the wire. Over
Tailscale it travels inside the WireGuard tunnel; over plain http on a LAN it is
cleartext. See [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md) for the threat model and the
one-command Tailscale https setup.

## Buddies (persistent employees)

The Unleashd package includes a versioned `@nbardy/buddies` snapshot; no manual
`node_modules` symlink is required. Buddy identity, canonical work, memory,
reporting lines, reviews, and automation runs live in
`~/.buddies/buddies.sqlite`.

Each Buddy also has a private curated `MEMORY.md` plus append-only journal
notes. Unleashd injects the bounded curated summary and recent journal excerpts
into the first turn of each Buddy conversation. The `remember` operation
records material outcomes, failures, durable decisions, and reusable lessons;
`compact_memory` reconciles repetitive or stale history with source
references. `BUDDY_SOUL.md` remains a stable, owner-reviewed behavior and
authority contract: Buddies may record `SOUL_CHANGE_PROPOSAL` journal entries,
but cannot silently rewrite their own Soul.

Initialize the Growth Lead team for the Magic Genie and EventMap checkouts:

```bash
MAGIC_GENIE_ROOT=../magic_genie \
EVENTMAP_ROOT=../event_calendars \
node node_modules/@nbardy/buddies/scripts/initialize-growth-lead.js
```

The initializer is idempotent. Confirm every imported campaign has a canonical
project with:

```bash
node node_modules/@nbardy/buddies/bin/buddies.js audit work
```

Back up the database before migrations or material manual changes:

```bash
node node_modules/@nbardy/buddies/bin/buddies.js \
  backup ~/.buddies/backups/buddies-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).sqlite
```

The store refuses to open a database whose schema is newer than the installed
library. Restore a backup rather than attempting an in-place downgrade.

When updating the sibling Buddies source, regenerate the vendored snapshot
twice and verify byte-for-byte reproducibility with:

```bash
pnpm vendor:buddies
```

Release packaging refuses an uncommitted or commit-less source tree. For a
clearly marked local development snapshot only, use
`pnpm vendor:buddies -- --allow-uncommitted`. The corresponding
`vendor/nbardy-buddies-0.1.0.provenance.json` records the archive SHA-256 and
whether the source was release-ready. Package smoke verifies that record.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Disk path read | Live spawn |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `~/.claude/projects/` | Yes |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `~/.codex/sessions/` | Yes |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) | `~/.local/share/opencode/` | No (read-only) |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `~/.gemini/tmp/` | Yes |

The server auto-discovers conversations from each agent's disk format. No configuration needed — if the CLI has been used, its sessions show up.
